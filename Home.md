Welcome to the Negativity wiki!

## What is Negativity ?

It's an anticheat. Its objective is to find cheaters, and ban them.
A lot of things are configurable, and detections are improved continuously.

## Why does Negativity exist ?

Cheaters are playing on many servers every day. When working on my minecraft server, I was searching for a cheat detector able to find and ban all cheaters, but there wasn't a lot of good anticheats so I created my own, Negativity.

## How are detection working ?

Before adding a detection, i'm testing the behaviour of the player. When i detect something special, I add a detection for it.

## Which cheats are detected ?

We have a [list of all detected cheats here](Cheat), with a description explaining what the cheat it covers does.

## I just downloaded it. What must I to configure ?

Firstly, thank you for download. The configuration file can be found at the default location for the platform you are using (`plugins/Negativity/config.yml` for Spigot).  
 
We recommend you to read it completely and edit everything you want. Make sure to reload or restart your server afterwards.

## I see a lot of permissions, I don't understand how it works, HELP !

Read the [Permissions page](Permissions) (currently incomplete).

## Everything works !

That's cool !
