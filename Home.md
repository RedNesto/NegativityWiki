Welcome to the Negativity wiki!

## What is Negativity ?

It's an anticheat. The objective is to find cheater, and ban her.
A lot of things are configurable, and detection are update sometimes.

## Why negativity exist ?

Everyday, there is new cheater. When I wanted to make a minecraft server, I was searching an cheat detector to ban all cheaters. But, like there was not a lot of good AC, i start the creation of negativity.

## Who detection works ?

Before adding a detection, i'm testing the behaviour of the player. When i detect something special, I add a detection for it.

## Which cheat are detected ?

There is a list of all detected cheat [here](https://github.com/Elikill58/Negativity/wiki/Cheat), with a little message which explain what do the hack.
